“The trained YOLOv11n model was evaluated on an unseen test dataset consisting of 501 images and 966 annotated objects across 15 classes. The model achieved an overall precision of 61.4%, recall of 43.1%, mAP@0.5 of 49.9%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 31.3%. Strong performance was observed for frequently occurring classes such as cellphone, plastic bag, glove, and net, while lower performance on rare classes was attributed to limited training samples. The model demonstrated efficient inference speed, making it suitable for real-time applications.”
